# AmusementParkPassGeneratorProject2
Build the user interface of an app that creates personalized passes for a variety of amusement park visitors and test if a set of business rules are enforced when the passes are swiped at various park locations.



You will now take the foundation you created in Previous Project (Amusement Park Generator (1)) and add the User Interface for the app, along with a short list of new features and entrant types handling. You might need to refactor some code in order to accommodate these changes.

Upon completion, you will have a functional iPad app, created entirely yourself! The app can take user input and create personalized entrant passes for all the entrant types. When the passes are being swiped at different locations in the park, business rules such as whether the entrant is allowed to access an area, whether the entrant can get a discount, will be tested.
